package goldenguard

// Determinism pre-check for golden writers.
//
// Why this exists: the existing two-key gate (AllowUpdate) protects
// against ACCIDENTALLY rewriting goldens, but it does not protect
// against rewriting them with NON-DETERMINISTIC bytes. A writer that
// shuffles map keys, embeds wall-clock timestamps, or formats floats
// locale-dependently will happily produce different bytes on each
// run. If a contributor regenerates such a fixture, pass-1 succeeds
// (the gate is satisfied), pass-2 (verify) fails — but the now-bad
// fixture is already on disk and may be committed by mistake.
//
// AssertWriterDeterministic runs the writer N times in-process and
// fails the test if any two runs disagree byte-for-byte. Call it
// BEFORE writing to disk so a non-deterministic writer is rejected
// at the source instead of poisoning testdata/.
//
// AllowUpdateAfterDeterminism bundles the check with the existing
// gate so callers can switch from `AllowUpdate(t, trigger)` to
// `AllowUpdateAfterDeterminism(t, trigger, label, writer)` and get
// both protections in one line.
