// Verifies that scanner.RepoInfo.Depth survives the mapper layer
// and lands in model.ScanRecord.Depth. Lightweight unit test —
// avoids the filesystem entirely by constructing a synthetic
// RepoInfo. The end-to-end "depth captured by the walker" path is
// covered separately in scanner/scanner_depth_test.go.
