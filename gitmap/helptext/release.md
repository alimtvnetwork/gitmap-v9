## Orphaned Metadata Recovery

If a `.gitmap/release/vX.Y.Z.json` file exists but neither the Git tag nor
the release branch is found, the command warns and prompts:

    ⚠ Release metadata exists for v2.3.10 but no tag or branch was found.
    → Do you want to remove the release JSON and proceed? (y/N):

Answering `y` removes the stale JSON file and proceeds with the release.
Answering `n` (or pressing Enter) aborts the release.

## Auto-bump (bare release, v3.19.0+)

When `gitmap release` (alias `r`) is invoked with **no version argument and
no `--bump` / `--commit` / `--branch` flag**, gitmap auto-increments the
**MINOR** segment of the last release. Behaviour depends on the cwd:

- **Inside a git repo** — reads `.gitmap/release/latest.json` (falling back
  to the highest local `v*` tag), computes `vX.(Y+1).0`, prints the
  proposal, and prompts `Proceed with this release? [y/N]`. `-y` skips the
  prompt.
- **From a directory containing many git repos** (cwd is NOT itself a git
  repo) — walks the tree with `scanner.ScanDir`, keeps only repos that
  already have a `.gitmap/release/latest.json`, prints a single summary
  table of the planned bumps, prompts ONCE for the whole batch, then runs
  each release sequentially. Failures are aggregated; the batch keeps
  going. `-y` skips the batch prompt.

Patch resets to `0` on a minor bump (`v3.4.7 → v3.5.0`). Any explicit
`--bump` / `--version` / `--commit` / `--branch` argument suppresses
auto-bump entirely, so existing scripted invocations are unaffected.

### Bare auto-bump example (single repo, with prompt)

    gitmap r

**Output:**

      Auto-bump: v3.18.0 → v3.19.0 (minor)
      Proceed with this release? [y/N]: y
    Creating branch release/v3.19.0... done
    Creating tag v3.19.0... done
    Pushing branch and tag... done
    ✓ Metadata written to .gitmap/release/v3.19.0.json
    ✓ Released v3.19.0

### Bare auto-bump example (single repo, `-y` skips prompt)

    gitmap r -y

**Output:**

      Auto-bump: v3.18.0 → v3.19.0 (minor)
      → -y supplied; proceeding without prompt.
    Creating branch release/v3.19.0... done
    ...
    ✓ Released v3.19.0

### Multi-repo batch example (cwd has child git repos)

    cd ~/code            # contains api/, web/, cli/  — each its own git repo
    gitmap r

**Output:**

      Auto-bump 3 repo(s) with prior releases:
        • api   v1.4.2 → v1.5.0
        • cli   v0.7.0 → v0.8.0
        • web   v2.1.0 → v2.2.0

      Proceed with all releases? [y/N]: y

      ── Releasing api → v1.5.0 ──
    ✓ Released v1.5.0

      ── Releasing cli → v0.8.0 ──
    ✓ Released v0.8.0

      ── Releasing web → v2.2.0 ──
    ✓ Released v2.2.0

      ✓ All 3 release(s) complete.

Repos without a prior `latest.json` are silently skipped (first-time
releases must still be created explicitly with a version argument). Add
`-y` to skip the batch prompt for unattended automation.

## Examples

    [DRY RUN] Would create branch release/v2.22.0
    [DRY RUN] Would create tag v2.22.0

    No changes made.

### Example 3: Release with assets and compression

    ✓ Released v3.0.0

### Example 4: Release with a persistent zip group

    gitmap release v3.0.0 --zip-group docs-bundle

**Output:**

    Creating branch release/v3.0.0... done

### Example 5: Release with notes

    gitmap release --bump patch -N 'Hotfix for auth timeout'

**Output:**

    v2.21.0 → v2.21.1
    → Release notes: Hotfix for auth timeout
    Creating branch release/v2.21.1... done
    Creating tag v2.21.1... done
    Pushing branch and tag... done
    ✓ Metadata written to .gitmap/release/v2.21.1.json
    ✓ Released v2.21.1

### Example 6: Release as a draft from a specific branch

    gitmap release v3.0.0-rc1 --branch develop --draft

**Output:**

    Creating branch release/v3.0.0-rc1 from develop... done
    Creating tag v3.0.0-rc1... done
    Pushing branch and tag... done
    ✓ Draft release created (not published)
    ✓ Metadata written to .gitmap/release/v3.0.0-rc1.json
    ✓ Released v3.0.0-rc1 (draft)

### Example 7: List resolved cross-compile targets

    gitmap release --list-targets

**Output:**

    Resolved 6 target(s):
    Source: built-in defaults
      windows/amd64
      windows/arm64
      linux/amd64
      linux/arm64
      darwin/amd64
      darwin/arm64

### Example 8: Release with auto-confirm and install hints (gitmap repo)

    gitmap release v2.61.0 -y

**Output:**

    Creating branch release/v2.61.0... done
    Creating tag v2.61.0... done
    Pushing branch and tag... done
    ✓ Metadata written to .gitmap/release/v2.61.0.json
    ✓ Auto-committed release metadata
    ✓ Auto-registered repo in gitmap database

      ── Release v2.61.0 complete ──

      📦  Install gitmap v2.61.0

      🪟  Windows (PowerShell)
         irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v9/main/gitmap/scripts/install.ps1 | iex

      🐧  Linux / macOS
         curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap-v9/main/gitmap/scripts/install.sh | sh

    $

Every trailer line (auto-commit, auto-register, install hint) ends on its
own newline so the shell prompt always lands on a fresh line — no PS1
flush against `curl … | sh`. Install hints only appear when the repo's
remote origin matches the gitmap source repository; non-gitmap repos are
unaffected.

## CI Release Pipeline

Pushing a `release/*` branch or `v*` tag triggers a GitHub Actions
workflow that automatically:

1. Cross-compiles 6 Go binaries (windows/linux/darwin × amd64/arm64)
2. Compresses assets (.zip for Windows, .tar.gz for Unix)
3. Generates SHA256 checksums
4. Creates version-pinned `install.ps1` and `install.sh` installers
5. Publishes a GitHub Release with changelog, metadata, and all assets

Local `--bin` builds are opt-in for development; the CI pipeline is
the recommended path for production releases.
